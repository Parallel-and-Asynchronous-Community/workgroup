# Inko

A language for building concurrent software with confidence
Inko makes it easy to build concurrent software, without having to worry about unpredictable performance, unexpected runtime errors, race conditions, and type errors.

Inko features deterministic automatic memory management, move semantics, static typing, type-safe concurrency, efficient error handling, and more.

Inko supports 64-bits Linux, macOS and Windows, and installing Inko is quick and easy.

# Golang

The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
